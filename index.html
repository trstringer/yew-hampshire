            <h2>What do we stand for?</h2>
            <p>
                We are a group of surfers 🏄 that ride waves 🌊 in New Hampshire and northern New England. We surf in July ☀️  and January ❄️ , dawn patrol 🌅 and last light. We surf when it's hot 🔥 and when it's cold 🥶. When the waves are small, and when the waves are big (if it's safe, and if that's your thing). We are all different levels of surfers, from learning to shredding. The best surfer is the one having the most fun.<br /><br />

               Surfing is a large part of our lives, but when there are other committments that is perfectly fine as well. When we can get together for a surf session, we do. And we like to have fun on the land too (when it's safe with COVID) with anything ranging from a backyard BBQ 🍔 to other fun sports and activities 🏂 ⛷  🚵.
